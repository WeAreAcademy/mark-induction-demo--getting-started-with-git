## What is git?

Git is a distributed version control system. Instead of saving a snapshot of the repository at that moment in time, it saves a full mirror of the repository on every team member's machine, including the full history of it. This means that if any singular machine were to have a problem, any of the others could be used to restore the database and its history. 

Git is free and open source. 

Software developers use version control both at work and for personal projects, and git is the most popular system to do this with by far. 

### How do git and GitHub compare?
